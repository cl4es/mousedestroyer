Simple arcade game, built to try out pyglet and your ability to click really really fast. 

## Installation

I've tested this using Python 2.6 and Pyglet 1.1.4 on Windows.

Install python 2.6, setuptools and run easy_install.exe pyglet and your environment should be up and running.

## Usage

    python mousedestroyer.py
    press n
    click!

## py2exe

To build a redistributable .exe, usable on most Windows systems, install py2exe and run: 
   
    ./setup.py py2exe

## Known Issues

It crashes on Ubuntu 9.10 running under VirtualBox, might be a bug in pyglet.
